# Coding Challenge Solution

## Dependencies
My solution is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Instructions
My solution is available as a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script. 
There are no significant differences between the two versions.

To run the notebook version: launch Jupyter Notebook, open `solution_notebook.ipynb`, then run all of the cells.

To run the script version, first navigate to the `solution` directory from the command line. 
Then run the script using the Python interpreter:
```
$ python3 solution_script.py
```
